{"title": "C++: The Object-Oriented Evolution of C", "content": "Building on the foundation of C, Bjarne Stroustrup created C++ in 1983. This language introduced object-oriented programming principles such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, which transformed software engineering. C++ remains a favorite for developing high-performance applications, including games, operating systems, and real-time systems. Its rich feature set and unmatched control make it ideal for performance-critical applications.", "date": "2024-03-03", "tags": ["C++", "Object-Oriented Programming", "Game Development", "High Performance"], "featured": false}
