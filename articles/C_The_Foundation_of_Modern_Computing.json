{"title": "C: The Foundation of Modern Computing", "content": "In 1972, Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs developed C, a language that revolutionized software development. C was initially created to rewrite the Unix operating system and quickly became a standard for systems programming. Its influence is so profound that most modern programming languages, including Python, Java, and C++, trace their roots to C. Even today, C is indispensable for low-level programming tasks, embedded systems, and operating systems.", "date": "2024-02-01", "tags": ["C", "Programming", "Systems Programming", "Unix", "Embedded Systems"], "featured": false}
