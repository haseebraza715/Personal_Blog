Python drew inspiration from the ABC language, which was known for its ease of learning. Released officially in 1991, Python rapidly gained traction for its simplicity and flexibility. Over the years, Python has become the backbone of fields like web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Its vast ecosystem of libraries and its thriving community ensure Python\u2019s relevance in the ever-evolving tech world.", "date": "2024-01-10", "tags": ["Python", "Programming", "History", "Data Science", "Machine Learning"], "featured": false}
